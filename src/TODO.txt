- Bind address "Resource in use" problem
  Currently use REUSEADDR to solve, but this is not good solution

- Browsers assumed Keep-Alive connection and will create 2 sockets
  The first contains HTTP request and will be closed after finishing handling
  but the second will send nothing so we will be blocked on read()
